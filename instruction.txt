To properly run the rockstar.py, one can create an conda environment with the rock.yml configuration file.

To use the hr mode,
The _data.star from last iteration of 2D classification, the resulting class average stacks, the dimensions of the images from which particles are extracted, and an output filename need to be provied.
Optionally, if the class average stacks are too small for you visualize, you can choose to specify a scale factor to make them bigger.

Example commands:
python ./rockstar.py hr --i Class2D/jobxxx/run_it025_data.star --mrcs Class2D/jobxxx/run_it025_classes.mrcs --micsx 5760 --micsy 4092 --o new_coords.star
python ./rockstar.py hr --i Class2D/jobxxx/run_it025_data.star --mrcs Class2D/jobxxx/run_it025_classes.mrcs --micsx 5760 --micsy 4092 --o new_coords.star  --scale 2

After successful running, the individual class average from stack will pop out for you to work on.
For the class that you want re-define the center, mouse click the center of the sub-region of interest. 
If not happy with the click, multiple clicks are allowed, and the program will only take the last click.

If you want to discard some of the class, just close the display window without doing anything.
If you dont want change the center but want to keep the class, middle mouse click anywhere in the image.

After navigating all the classses, a star file with new coordinates will be generated, whch can be fed into RELION for particle extraction.




subset mode
The subset mode was designed for the situation that the data processing begins from zero with RELION.
What is only retrieved from the Cryosparc file in the the columns equivalen to _rlnImageName column in RELION, other information such as ctf and alignment info are discarded.
To convert all the columns of cs to star, csparc2star.py in pyem is recommended.
The user must gurantee the cs file are derived form the input star file. Otherwise, it fails.
The output star file is exactly a subset of the input star file, and can be directly fed into RELION for further processing.

Example commands:
python ./rockstar.py subset --i Extract/job004/particles.star --subset /abs/path/to/J1112/particles_selected.cs --o J1112.star
